# [**Chapter Overview**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   **Health Indicators and Indices**: What are their characteristics and why are they important?
-   **Sources and Evaluation of Health Data**: Primary, secondary data, passive and active collection.
-   **Disease Definition and Classification**: How do we classify diseases? (ICD9, ICD10-codes)
-   **Diagnostic Tests and Disease Surveillance**: Is a test accurate? What about specificty and sensitivity? True Positive or False Negative?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [1]{.circle} [**Health Indicators and Indices**]{style="color: teal;"}

-   **Health Indicators**: Directly measurable variables reflecting a population's health such as infant mortality rate and life expectancy.
-   **Health Indices**: Composite measures combining multiple indicators to give an overview of health status, like the Human Development Index.

![](imgs/index.jpg){fig-align="center" width="527"}

-   See [**Box 3.1**]{.highlight-box} and [**Box 3.3**]{.highlight-box} for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [**Evaluating Health Indicators**]{style="color: pink;"}

-   How are health indicators used to monitor and assess population health, informing public health decisions and policy-making?

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%" style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.2;"}
#### Essential Qualities {style="color: blue;"}

-   **Reliability/Reproducibility**: Consistent results across studies and time.
-   **Validity**: Accurately measures what it is intended to measure.
-   **Sensitivity**: Detects changes or differences that are meaningful.

#### Practical Qualities {style="color: blue;"}

-   **Acceptability**: Acceptable to those who are assessed by the indicator.
-   **Feasibility**: Can be realistically collected and sustained.
-   **Universality**: Applicable across different settings and populations.

## [2]{.circle} [**Sources and quality of health data**]{style="color: teal;"}

- See [**Table 3.1**]{.highlight-box} -sources of data to compilate indicators.
- Health data sources are crucial for compiling health indicators.
- Data can originate from individuals, healthcare providers, or be generated through health surveys and administrative databases.

### [**Active or passive?**]{style="color: pink;"}
- **Active Data Sources**: Require efforts to solicit and collect information, e.g., health surveys.
- **Passive Data Sources**: Routinely submitted by other entities, e.g., vital statistics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [**Primary and Secondary Data Sources**]{style="color: pink;"}
- **Primary Data Sources**: Specifically collected for the purpose of health monitoring (e.g. disease registries and some health surveys).

  - **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: Detailed, real-time, patient-centered records.
  - **Disease Registries**: Used to estimate disease incidence and prevalence, like cancer registries.

- **Secondary Data Sources**: Originally designed for other purposes but also used in health monitoring (e.g.administrative databases for Medicare and Medicaid).



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [**Health Information System (HIS)**]{style="color: pink;"}

- An organized set of activities whose purpose is to **gather, maintain, and provide health-related information** to improve health outcomes.

- Components:
  - Disease registries
  - Utilization databases
  - National health surveys

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [**Disease Registries and Notifiable Diseases**]{style="color: pink;"}

- **Disease Registries**
  - Important for estimating disease incidence and prevalence.
  - Cover various conditions from cancer to communicable diseases.

- **Notifiable Diseases**
  - Diseases that must be reported to national health authorities.
  - Managed by systems like the CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.
  
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [**Utilization of Health Data**]{style="color: pink;"}


- **Measuring Health Service Utilization**
  - Utilization data from Medicare, Medicaid, and health maintenance organizations provide insights into health service use.

- **Health Surveys**
  - Gather data on health behaviors, practices, and perceptions.
  - Vary by mode of interview and can be influenced by respondentsâ€™ perceptions and recall accuracy.
  - See [**Table 3.2**]{.highlight-box} for pros and cons of survey type
  - Cross-section (versus longitudinal)
  - Likert scale!
  - Self-rated survey
    - Surprisingly good (dynamic)
  - QOL - see the one for [Charlotte, NC](https://mcmap.org/qol/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [**Linking health data**]{style="color: pink;"}

- **Enhanced Insights**: Linking different data sources can provide a more comprehensive view of health outcomes.
- **Examples of Linked Data**: Combining EHRs with national health surveys or insurance claim data.

- **Data Challenges**
  - **Data Integrity and Privacy**: Managing the accuracy and confidentiality of linked data is paramount. 
    - <span style="color: red;">**HIPAA!**</span> 
    - [List of HIPAA identifiers](https://biospecimens.cancer.gov/resources/sops/docs/GTEx_SOPs/BBRB-ER-0001-F1%20List%20of%20HIPAA%20Identifiers.pdf)
  - **Analytical Complexity**: The use of linked data often requires advanced statistical techniques to manage biases and variability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## [3]{.circle} [**Summary measures of population health**]{style="color: teal;"}

### [**Integrating Mortality and Morbidity**]{style="color: pink;"}
- Health indices like DFLE, DALE, DALY, HALE, QALY, and HLY combine measures of mortality with morbidity or disability into a single comprehensive figure.
- These measures differ in how they account for morbidity:
  - Activities of daily living
  - Self-rated health
  - Activity limitations (institutional and non-institutional)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [**Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY)**]{style="color: pink;"}
- **Definition**: A measure that combines the length of life with the quality of life in a single index number.
- **Calculation**: Each year in perfect health is counted as one QALY, while years lived with illness or disability are adjusted according to the severity of the health condition.

### [**Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY)**]{style="color: pink;"}
- **Definition**: A measure that reflects the total number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death.
- **Calculation**: Sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years lost due to disability.
